# Photographic-data-binning
The following program takes an image in text image format as input and analyzes arbitrary groups of pixels by extracting them as sub-matrices of image, computing the variance of the pixels within the image (based on their relative position), to write the variance array in output to another file. Used to estimate the noise and experimental error of measures performed on the image.
